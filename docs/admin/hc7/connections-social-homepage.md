# HCL Connections Social Homepage

[Official HCL Documentation](https://help.hcltechsw.com/connections/v7/user/homepage/Tile_homepage_using.html)

For Connections 7, the Social Homepage (also known as orient-me) is set as the default landing page.

The previous activity stream based homepage can be activated with the homepage switcher:
![Homepage Switcher](/assets/images/admin/orientme/switcher.png)

## Known issues

The Homepage Switcher setting is stored in the browser's storage. If you switch the browser or clear the local browser storage, the Social Homepage will be your default Homepage.

The language switcher does not work.
