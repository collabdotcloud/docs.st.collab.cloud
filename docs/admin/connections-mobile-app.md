### Push Notifications

Push Notifications to Mobile are enabled and are applied to the following list of events:

- The user is invited to join a community.
- The user is invited to join a person's network.
- A user is @mentioned.
- A comment is added to content that the user owns.

Note: A user has to login to their Connections account in the mobile app before they can receive any push notifications. They will continue to receive notifications even if the app is not running. If the user explicitly logs out, they will stop receiving push notifications for the account.
Customers can disable push notifications using the Connections Mobile Administration for their organization.
