# Single Sign On (SSO) with your Identity Provider (IDP)

If your IDP supports SAML or OIDC it should be possible to configure single sign-on.

If you are using Microsoft Azure AD / Entra ID it's possible to use it.

Any IDP supporting SAML or OIDC should be possible.

> **Note:** ThreeThirds offer some limited Federated Identity SSO options with your on-premises idP - such as Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS). These options will be expanded in the future.

---
> **Limitations**: Guest accounts need to be in your IDP as well. Once SSO is enabled, all authentication is forwarded to your IDP.

Please contact your ThreeThirds account representative for more information.
