If you need to change the Ownership of Communities where you don't have direct access as a Member/Owner, just open a user's entry in the Admin App to list all Communites the user belongs to as described [here](https://docs.collab.cloud/admin/communities-list-per-user/)

Click on the appropriate Community's entry and click the VIEW button to open the Community in Connections.

There you can can open the Members section and do the changes.
