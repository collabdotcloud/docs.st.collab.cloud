If you want a user to be able to create support tickets in our support tool,
edit the user document and enable the "Support Role" option.
Save the change.

This will put the user automatically in the appropriate access group to access the support tool.

To remove the user from that role, edit the user document and disable the option.
Save the change.

**NOTE**: If you have SSO configured with our environment be aware that the user password is not stored in our LDAP.
Therefore, the user needs to set a password in our system to use the support tool. This can be done as an Org-Admin via the "RESET PASSWORD" option within the admin app.
