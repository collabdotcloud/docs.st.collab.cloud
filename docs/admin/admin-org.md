# Managing Your Organisation

## Logging into the Administration Console

Administrators can log into the _ThreeThirds Collaboration Admin_ app by clicking the Cog icon in the top right of the screen in the Header Banner.
In some browsers the icon does not show up on initial load, this is a bug we are workign on with HCL. A refresh brings it back.

## Managing settings

> Currently the _ThreeThirds Collaboration Admin_ app has limited functionality. The table below indicates management items that can be performed with the Admin App today.
> Depending in your account type and environment - other functions may be performed in your on-premise Domino Directory, or by request to support at [support@collab.cloud](mailto:support@collab.cloud).
