## Assigning tasks to members

Assign a task to a member by taking the profile picture of that member drag and drop it upon the task. That user then get a notification email saying they have a task assigned to them.

It is easy to see on the task who has been assigned to which task. If you want to remove a member from a task, simply drag and drop the same profile picture on the task again.
