Although they could in IBM Cloud, a person from one organisation cannot join or be added to a Community from another organisation. If a Community that was migrated from IBM Cloud previously had such a member, their community status updates are preserved, but any files from their organisation linked to in the updates are NOT available, and those links are broken.
