## Making Your Board Public

When you activate **_Public Access_**, your board will be discoverable by anyone in your organisation. You'll be asked to select Reader, Author, or Editor to decide what level of access your organisation can have to the activity. Additionally, updates that you make on your activity may be included in linked activity streams in HCL Connections.

To give your activity public access, navigate to your desired activity. Select **_Members_** and then select **_Public Access_**. Decide what level of access, Reader, Author or Editor, your organisation will have.
