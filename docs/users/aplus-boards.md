## Boards view

Kudos Boards lets you organise your tasks and teamwork any way you like.

Create lists based on tasks at hand, to-do and completed? Per project or per day, week or month? The choice is entirely up to you.

### Create Boards for just about anything

Sales Tracking, Event Management, Customer Support, Agile Projects, Employee Onboarding, Billing Cycles and other Admin processes, the list is endless.

### Real time cross-team updates

Kudos Boards updates in real time across multiple users. You can literally see the information update from another user on your screen, including when they drag and drop items from one list to another.

## Timeline view

In our Timeline view you get the perfect overview of your tasks.

Perfect for project planning and monitoring deadlines. See exactly who does what and when and keep track on your project in real time. Resource planning. Time planning. Know when your project needs to finish!

Drag and drop tasks, tags and people directly in the swim lanes of the timeline. Adjust deadline. Plan weeks and months of work.

## MindMap view

In our MindMap view you get the perfect overview of your tasks. Great for brainstorming sessions or that helicopter view of your project.

Start on a blank canvas and build up your project as if you had post-it notes on a whiteboard. Move your tasks around with easy drag-and drop.
