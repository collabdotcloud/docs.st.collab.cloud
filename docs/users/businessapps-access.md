# How To Access Business Apps and add an app to a Connections Community

Before you start working in ThreeThirds Business Apps an account needs to be created. In order to create an account and access and work in ThreeThirds Business Apps, the Business Apps widget needs to be added to the Community. A Community Owner/Manager has access rights to do this.

To add the Business Apps widget, go to:

**_Community Actions â€“ Add Apps_** in the right hand side of the Community

Select **_Business Apps_** in the list

Once the widget is added you have the option to show all Community Apps that belongs to this Community, or a specific Community App. If you want to change these settings after saving, simply delete the widget and start over by adding it again to the Community.

The new widget in the Community can be moved by dragging and dropping, or by clicking on the three dots in the upper right corner.

A great tip is to move the widget so it covers the whole page, by dragging and dropping. When the widget is larger you get a better overview of your work.
