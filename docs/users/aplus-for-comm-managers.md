# How To Add Activities to a Connections Community

In order to access and work in a Community Activity the Activities Plus widget needs to be added to the Community. A Community Owner/Manager has access rights to do that.

To add the Activities Plus widget, go to:

**_Community Actions – Add Apps_** in the right hand side of the Community

![Community Actions Add Apps](/assets/images/screen-shots/aplus/aplus-community-actions-add-apps.png)

Select **_Activities Plus_** in the list

![Add Apps](/assets/images/screen-shots/aplus/aplus-add-apps.png){:width="50%"}

Once the widget is added you have the option to show all Community Activities/Boards that belongs to this Community, or a specific Activity/Board. If you want to change these settings after saving, click on the settings wheel inside the widget.

The new widget in the Community can be moved by dragging and dropping, or by clicking on the three dots in the upper right corner.

A great tip is to move the Activities Plus widget so it covers the whole page, by dragging and dropping. When the widget is larger you get a better overview of your work.

If the Community already is a member of an Activity you will directly see that Activity in the widget. Start working immediately!

If you do not see any Activities you can add Activities now.

## Add an existing Activity into the widget

Go to the Activities Plus page by clicking

**_Apps – Activities Plus_** in the Menu Bar

![Activities Plus homepage](/assets/images/screen-shots/aplus/aplus-homepage.png)

Open the Activity of your choice by clicking on it.

Open the Members section of the Activity by clicking on **_Members_** in the right hand side

In the field **_Add individuals or groups_** type the first letters of the Community name you want to add the Activity to, and select it.

All members of this Community will now be added as members into the Activity. The Activity will also be added into the Community, and be visible in the widget.

Before you click **_Add Members_** and close the dialogue box you have the option to set access rights for the members who will be added to the Activity.

## Create a new Activity in the Community Widget

In the Activities Plus widget, click the **_Orange plus_** in the bottom right hand side corner. A dialogue box will open with options for your new Activity.

![New Activity](/assets/images/screen-shots/aplus/aplus-new-activity.png){:width="50%"}

Once the new Activity is created you will see and be able to work in this Activity directly in the Community.

You can also work in this Activity if you go to the Activities Plus homepage. If you open the Member section of the Activity, you will see that the Community now is a Member of this Activity.
