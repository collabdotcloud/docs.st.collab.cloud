# Community File Trash

The Community File Trash only works for community files. These are the files which have been uploaded or created in the community.

Files Shared with a community cannot be moved to the trash. The only way to remove those files from a community is by stop shareing them with the community.

**Community Folders are not supported.** Folders are being deleted immediatly and can't be restored. The files in a folder are still accessible in the community file list. These files are not deleted.

## Move files to the trash

To prevent a file from being accidentially deleted, the *move to trash* button can only be accessed through advanced menus

If you Delete a file in Desktop Connector, the file will also end up in the trash.
