# Activities Plus Mobile app

You can access and work with your Activities on your mobile device. Activities Plus is part of and made by the Kudos Boards team, so we use the Kudos Boards Mobile app to access the Activities Plus Activities.

## Download the app to your device

Download the Kudos Boards Cloud App from either Apple AppStore or Google Play Store

For iPhone: [Kudos Boards Cloud App](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/kudos-boards-for-cloud/id1348187330)

For Android: [Kudos Boards Cloud App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kudosboards.pwa&hl=en_AU)

## Login to the Kudos Boards Cloud App

When you start the app and reach the login screen you have multiple options on how to identify yourself towards Activities Plus and Kudos Boards.

In this case you should choose either **_Collab Cloud US_** or **_Collab Cloud Europe_** depending on which data center you are connected to. If you do not have that information, please contact your administrator.
