#Events widget display issues workaround

We are currently experiencing issues with the events widget in our environment, we are working hard with HCL to solve this. In the meanwhile please consider this workaround.

## Add Highligts and set as landing page

The new Highlights application ( [New Connections 7 feature](https://docs.collab.cloud/admin/hc7/highlights/){:target="_blank"} ) contains a new widget that uses a different way of loading than the classical events widget. This one works, so first step is to add the Highlights Application and set it as the start page for the community

- Go to your Community overview page, click Community Actions - Add Apps

- Select the Highlights Application

- Note that through drag and drop you can reposition this widget anywhere on the page, it will resize into the block you choose
