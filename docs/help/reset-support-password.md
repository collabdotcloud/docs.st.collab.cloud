# How to reset your Support Portal password

Your support Portal password and your password on your collab.cloud environment are the same. So resetting your password is done on your dedicated collab.cloud url. See the following [link](https://docs.collab.cloud/users/using-connections-gettingstarted/) for instructions.
If you are in an organisation that uses Single Sign on we do not have a password in our system for you and you will need to set it. Please see the instructions below.

### Connect to your dedicated URL

You should have received a dedicated URL from us for your organization.
The format is *https://customername.collab.cloud*

### Open the Admin App App

Once you are logged in, using the link in the header, go to the Admin application as explained on [this page](https://docs.collab.cloud/admin/admin-org/). In the menu on the left select **_"My Users"_** and find your own user. Then hit the **_"Reset Password"_** button and then **_"Set Password"_**
