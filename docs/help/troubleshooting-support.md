# Troubleshooting & Support

## General Support

Welcome to our new Support Portal!

In order to help our customers in an efficient and fast way, we have started working in a support portal which all organisations in the ThreeThirds environment has access to. The goal is to make it easy for you to log issues with us, to get clearer updates, and ultimately to present solutions to you in a better way.

In the Support Portal you will be able to see all your ongoing cases.

### All organisations have access to the Support Portal

All Organisation Admins have access to this portal and your account has been created already. You log in with the same username and password as for the ThreeThirds environment. If you log in with SSO you will have to click the "Forgot Password" button on the login page, and you will receive an email with instructions.

If you experience a problem with any of our services, and want to open a support case, please go to
