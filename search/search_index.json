For the documentation for the Connections API please refer to the official Connections API documentation: HCL Connections API Documentation We currently use version 6.5 on our Multi-Tenant environment. How do I get access to the API? \u00b6 The APIs support only Oauth/OIDC access. Please open a support ticket if you want to use the API's. You will then be provided with your Client-ID and Client-Secret. Important: Please keep your Client-Secret a secret and only give it to people that need it and store it safely. To reach us, please use support.collab.cloud and open a new ticket. Open a request with a subject and description that lets us know that you need access to the API. We will then provide you with your Client-ID and Client-Secret . Future plans \u00b6 We know this work-flow isn't ideal, and we are building a better system to manage your API clients and client-secrets right inside the Admin-App. See our roadmap for more information. Service Accounts \u00b6 We currently don't have dedicated service accounts. However, every normal user can function as a service account and authenticate programmatically. Meaning, you can create a new separate user, dedicated to call the Connections APIs. It needs the same subscriptions as a normal Connections user. Authentication & Usage \u00b6 The Connections API is the same as on every Connections environment. However, the authentication to Connection is different. We use OAuth 2.0 which is more modern and secure. After successful authentication, the API calls are exactly as in an On-Prem environment. Using OAuth 2.0 for Connections APIs \u00b6 HCL Connections has APIs that support OAuth 2.0 but also some that don't and only support \"Basic Authentication\". We use OAuth 2.0 for all authentication, and basic authentication is not supported. You can still use the Basic-Auth APIs on our Connections environment like this: This flow explains how to authenticate to call any API from Connections. If you want to perform calls to HCL Connections API endpoints that require basic authentication, you will need to follow this authentication flow. If you instead only want to use an OAuth 2.0 capable API endpoints, you can skip step 2 in this flow and simply provide the bearer token. Basic only API endpoints need to be called with the Ltpa2Token Cookie. If you have the Cookie in your request headers, you won't need to supply credentials in your request. The token in the cookie proves your identity. Authentication Manual \u00b6 1. Make an authentication request to the OIDC Endpoint \u00b6 Call our Open-ID Connect token endpoint . Please, use the correct one for your data centre. Which one? Use the following OAuth 2.0 config: Grant-Type: Client-Credentials Username: Your users' username (E-mail) Password: Your users' password Client-ID: Your client ID - What is that? Client-Secret: Your client secret - Where do I find it? Example: We will use the EU endpoint in this example. Request: POST https://logineu.collab.cloud/auth/realms/connections-mt/protocol/openid-connect/token Body: (Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded ) grant_type:password username:*Your username (E-mail)* password:*Your user's password* client_id:*Your Client-ID* client_secret:*Your Client-Secret* scope:profile Response: (Content-Type: application/json ) { \"access_token\": \"... your access token ...\", \"expires_in\": 42900, \"refresh_expires_in\": 43200, \"refresh_token\": \"... your refresh token ...\", \"token_type\": \"bearer\", \"not-before-policy\": 0, \"session_state\": \"... you session state ...\", \"scope\": \"email connectionsmt profile\" } You will then be able to use the access token as a bearer token in the next requests until it expires. When it expires, you will need to perform this request again and get a new token. 2. Call Connections OAuth Endpoint for the LTPA Token \u00b6 This step is only needed if you want to call a Basic API afterwards. To be able to use the Basic APIs you need the LTPA Token from Connections in its Cookie. And to get this cookie you need to call an OAuth 2.0 capable endpoint. Perform a GET request to /files/oauth/api/nonce with the Access token from the previous request as the bearer token in the Authorization header. We are not interested in the body that is returned. It will be an arbitrary Connections ID. We only want the cookie. Example: Please make sure to put your tenant into the subdomain. Request: GET https://YOUR_TENANT.collab.cloud/files/oauth/api/nonce Headers: \"Authorization\": \"Bearer <Your token>\" Response: Cookies: Name Value Domain Path Expires HttpOnly Secure LtpaToken2 *Your LTPA Token* collab.cloud / Session true true The response will be an ID from Connections which we are not interested in. We are only making this request to get the Cookie with the Ltpa2Token. The Cookie will be in the response header. 3. Use the Connections API with the LTPA token \u00b6 If you are using a proper application or library that can handle cookies, the cookie will now automatically be set for the following request to that domain. As long as your session is active and the cookie is set in the request, you will now be able to call any Connections API you want to. Example: In this example, we are searching for users named Bob. We use the Profiles search API, as documented here . Request GET https://YOUR_TENANT.collab.cloud/profiles/atom/search.do?name=Bob Headers: \"Cookie\": \"LtpaToken2=<Your LTPA token>\" Response (Content-Type: application/xml ) <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> ... Here come the Bob's ... Open-ID Connect Endpoints \u00b6 There are different endpoint URLs for every data center. Europe \u00b6 Authentication endpoint: https://logineu.collab.cloud/auth/realms/connections-mt/protocol/openid-connect/auth Token endpoint: https://logineu.collab.cloud/auth/realms/connections-mt/protocol/openid-connect/token Endpoint Configuration: EU Open-ID configuration https://logineu.collab.cloud/auth/realms/connections-mt/.well-known/openid-configuration To see the supported features of the Enpoint and the current configuration, take a look at the JSON response of this URL. North America \u00b6 Authentication endpoint: https://loginna.collab.cloud/auth/realms/connections-mt/protocol/openid-connect/auth Token endpoint: https://loginna.collab.cloud/auth/realms/connections-mt/protocol/openid-connect/token Endpoint Configuration: US Open-ID configuration https://loginna.collab.cloud/auth/realms/connections-mt/.well-known/openid-configuration To see the supported features of the Enpoint and the current configuration, take a look at the JSON response of this URL. Customers with SSO \u00b6 If your tenant is enabled for Single Sign On (SSO) with your tenant's own IDP and you need to do scheduled updates - not in the users browser session - then you need an admin user and it's credentials need to be set in our directory. create a user in our admin portal and assing him the admin role test the login to your tenants connections site with this admin user goto EU or US page and reset the password there. Samples \u00b6 Both examples use the password grant flow. This flow is used, as both examples run directly on server/client. CURL \u00b6 This example uses CURL to access the Connections Files API. It will get 10 latest files and stores it in myuserlibrary.xml Replace the URL with your connections collab cloud url. #!/bin/sh # Tested on UBUNTU 20.04 CLIENT_SECRET = <CLIENT-SECRET> CLIENT_ID = <CLIENT-ID> USERNAME = <EMAIL-ADDRESS> # Make sure that the password is properly encoded # + -> %2B PASSWORD = <PASSWORD> URL = https://threethirdseu.collab.cloud TOKEN_ENDPOINT = https://logineu.collab.cloud DATA = \"grant_type=password&client_id= $CLIENT_ID &client_secret= $CLIENT_SECRET &password= $PASSWORD &username= $USERNAME \" curl -o req1.json -k -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" --data $DATA $TOKEN_ENDPOINT /auth/realms/connections-mt/protocol/openid-connect/token -X POST TOKEN = ` jq '.access_token' req1.json ` TOKEN2 = ${ TOKEN % \\\" } TOKEN2 = ${ TOKEN2 # \\\" } NONCE = ` curl -k -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN2 \" $URL /files/oauth/api/nonce -X GET -c cookies.txt ` curl -o myuserlibrary.xml -b cookies.txt -k $URL /files/basic/api/myuserlibrary/feed?includePath = true & includeQuota = true & ps = 10 & sortBy = updated Lotusscript \u00b6 Sample Implementation using Lotusscript can be found here .

It is very difficult to remove these after the Connections Cloud site has been removed from the plugin. Standard Method \u00b6 There are some known issues removing the old Connections Cloud configuration from the desktop connector. The recommended procedure for disconnecting the old Connections Cloud configuration is the following: Open Windows Explorer. In the left navigation pane, find and expand the Connections plugin item. In the expanded menu, identify the site you wish to remove. Right click the site, and in the menu that appears click \"Disconnect from site\". A Workaround for the \"Files are in Use\" Error \u00b6 In the majority of cases, the standard method for removing the Connections Cloud configuration works. However some customers have reported that they cannot disconnect the Connections Cloud site because they receive an error stating that there are files are in use. This is a known-issue, and the recommended work-around is to open task manager, restart the Windows Explorer task, and then immediately attempt to disconnect from the Connections Cloud site using the standard method detailed above. Some customers have also reported that they were able to disconnect from the Connections Cloud site if they performed the standard method immediately upon the computer booting. A Procedure for Total Removal of the Previous Configuration \u00b6 The default behaviour of the HCL Connections Desktop Plugin for Windows is to maintain the configuration between installations. If you are experiencing difficulties removing the previous Connections Cloud configuration, then the following procedure will resolve them for you by completely removing the plugin and all configurations. From Windows Explorer, right click the site to remove and select \"Stop using sync\" and then \"Disconnect from site\". Uninstall the plugin. If there is still a node (e.g. \"My Drive on <Server Name>\") in the left navigation pane of Windows Explorer that cannot be deleted, then you must follow the process below. Otherwise, proceed directly to step four. Identify the classid value for the node. This is found under the \"RegCLSID\" key in the registry at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\IBM\\Social Connectors\\Servers\\<Server Number>\\SyncLibraries\\1 . Alternatively you can find it at: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Desktop\\NameSpace under a subkey that will have String value data that matches the name of the node you are trying to remove. The name of that subkey is the classid value. Save it somewhere, as you will require it later. Note that there is a chance there will not be a subkey with a String value that matches the name of the node you are trying to remove. In this case, the subkey you are looking for is the one which has no default value, and you need to save the name of that subkey. The HCL Connections Desktop Plugin for Windows sets four registry values when adding a site to the left navigation pane in Windows Explorer that need to be manually deleted.

New user creation and updates to a user's name or email address should be performed in your on-premises Domino Directory. The following is for Administrators to consider: Your on-premises Domino Directory is synchronised with the central collab.cloud directory. All new users should be registered in the Domino Directory, and a Notes ID password created as normal to be deployed in the ID Vault. Notes ID passwords are for Notes only, and are not used to authenticate to Connections, Verse mail, apps in cloud, plugins or other collab.cloud services. Administrators need to log into the Admin App to set a password for a new user. (see Directory Sync) If you are registering an on-premises mail or apps user - this procedure will still apply in most cases. For example: You have an on-premises mail user that needs to use Connections in collab.cloud . You can assign a Connections license if your Organization is licensed for Connections. You have a user that will have no mailbox at all, but needs to use other on-premises Domino services/apps as well as Connections in collab.cloud . Directory Sync \u00b6 Your mail cluster is configured to synchronize your Domino Directory with the collab.cloud identity management system and the Admin App approximately every 3 minutes ** The Directory Sync process will detect changes in the Domino Directory and perform the following: Add new users registered in the Domino Directory to collab.cloud and be visible in the Admin App. Assign a Clustered Mail Cloud license to: Any new users who are registered and their mailboxes created on collab.cloud mail servers. Any existing mail users who have been moved/updated to collab.cloud mail servers and mailboxes transferred via Domino (adminP) process. Any existing Connections users in collab.cloud who have later been registered in the Domino Directory for mail. (linked by email address) Modify basic name information for a user such as First/Last name, email address. (see Updating User Info) Remove Clustered Mail Cloud license from any users who have been deleted from the Domino Directory and set the user status to Inactive ** The 3 minute Sync heartbeat is being rolled out during May 2021. This will be the default setting but may differ in your Organiztion. Please log a support ticket via support@collab.cloud for more information. After the sync process has created/updated the user in the Admin App - you can then set a password and (if required) assign a Connections or other license. You may also notice that the Shortname/UserID field in the Person Document is updated with a unique number or univeral ID value. For users migrated from IBM Cloud it may be a value like 200112345 For new users it may be a value like 60474dad-d943-404c-8e1a-fb096bc54716 This is the assigned UID from the collab.cloud identity system and is critical for Connections/Mail/IM integration and authentication. Please do not remove this value! It will just reappear on the next Sync and break functionality in the meantime! Register user in Domino Directory \u00b6 Register the user as per your normal process, ensuring that your nominated collab.cloud mail servers have been specified, and that correct Policies are applied. Set/Reset user password \u00b6 Clicking the reset password button gives you 2 options as follows: Use the \"Set password\" link for new users. This allows you to set a temporary password for the user that they will need to change as soon as they login for the first time. Clicking \"Send reset email\" sends a link to the user at their specified email address that they can click on to set their password. PLEASE NOTE: For new mail users - you need to use the \"Set password\" function. As the user cannot retrieve the password email if they have never logged in to their email! Updating User Info in Domino Directory \u00b6 Name changes (such as firstname., lastname and email address) performed via the Domino Administrations Process (adminP) will be synchronized with the collab.cloud Admin App. If the user has a Connections license - additonal steps are required . If you are renaming a mail & Connections user, you need to log into the Admin App to perform a re-save to update the Connections Profile: Rename/change the user's name information via Domino Administration Process (adminP). Wait for the updates to sync to the collab.cloud Admin App. Select the user in the Admin App, edit the user's record and re-save.

For example: You have an on-premises mail user that needs to use Connections in collab.cloud . You can assign a Connections license if your Organization is licensed for Connections.

The \"Report-to Chain\" of an organisation refers to the organizational tree of an organisation. It's about who has to report to whom and who is managed by whom. An organisation admin can update the Report-to Chain for their organisation in the admin app. This can be done in two ways, by uploading a CSV with the updated information or using drag and drop, for quick and easy changes. The Report-to Chain page can be accessed by clicking on the Report-to Chain button on the Org-Users page. On the Report-to Chain page you will see three tabs: View & Export Editor Update with CSV As an Admin you can update the \"Report-to Chain\" for your organization here. You can update it using a CSV file. View & Export \u00b6 In the View and Export tab, you can view the current Report-to Chain for your organisation and export it as a CSV. The exported CSV can be used to update the Report-to Chain or simply as a backup of sorts or to compare to Report-to Chains from different points of time. The tree displays which users are managed by which. For example: User 1 User 2 User 3 User 4 In this example, User 1 is the manager of Users 2 and 3 and User 3 is the manager of User 4. User 1 could for example be a CEO, User 3 a manager and users 2 and 4 employees managed by the CEO and the manager respectively. Editor \u00b6 In the Editor tab, you can make changes to the current Report-to Chain using Drag and Drop. The tree has the same structure as the one under 'View & Export'. When dragging users you can think of it as setting a user as managed by another. Meaning if you drag 'User A' from somewhere and drop it on 'User B' you are setting 'User A' as managed by 'User B'. To the right of the drag and drop editor, you can see the exact changes that will be made. It should now read: \"Setting User A as manager of User B \" You can now click 'Apply changes' to apply your changes or click 'Discard changes' to undo everything. Update with CSV \u00b6 You can also update the Report-to Chain for your organization with a CSV -file. You can always export the current Report-to Chain in the 'View & Export' tab to get the CSV-file for the full Report-to Chain in the correct format. Also please refer to the CSV structure found in this documentation. Note: The CSV does not replace the Report-to chain, it will only update it. Meaning, if a user is missing in the CSV it won't remove it from the Report-to Chain. It will not touch missing users and leave them as-is. Therefore you don't need a CSV file with the full Report-to chain and can simply update just a part of the Report-to chain. We will always show you exactly what changes will be made after uploading the CSV and you will have to confirm the changes before anything is changed in the database. CSV structure \u00b6 Each user has its own row and the columns are the data points for all the users. The columns are the following in this order: Columns: emailAddress , uid , isManager , managerEmail , managerUid emailAddress : The E-Mail address of the user uid : The Connections userID of the user isManager : Y for yes or N for no managerEmail : The E-mail address of the manager of this user. Can be empty if the user has no manager managerUid : The Connections userID of the manager of this user. Can be empty if the user has no manager UIDs vs. E-Mails \u00b6 To update a user either its uid or emailAddress needs to be given. (Otherwise, the row is ignored) To set it as managed by some other user, one of managerUid or managerEmail needs to be given, otherwise it is understood as not managed by anyone. It is best-practise to also supply both if the UID and E-Mail are known. It is much quicker to update the Report-to Chain with a CSV that includes UIDs. However, it is perfectly possible to update the Report-to Chain only with E-Mail addresses, but it will take longer. This is because we have to perform a look-up for every user without a UID. Therefore we suggest exporting and downloading the CSV for the full Report-to Chain after a successful update. It will include all UIDs and E-mail for all the users and you can edit said CSV Example \u00b6 Structure: user3@orga.com.au user1@orga.com.au user5@orga.com.au Preview table: emailAddress uid isManager managerEmail managerUid user1@orga.com.au 1000000001 Y user3@orga.com.au 1000000003 user3@orga.com.au 1000000003 Y user5@orga.com.au 1000000005 N user1@orga.com.au 1000000001 CSV file content: emailAddress,uid,isManager,managerEmail,managerUid user1@orga.com.au,1000000001,Y,user3@orga.com.au,1000000003 user3@orga.com.au,1000000003,Y,, user5@orga.com.au,1000000005,N,user1@orga.com.au,1000000001 Explaination: User 1 is managed by user 3 but is also a manager itself.

Community overview page stays empty If I click on Community, only the top header shows and the rest of the page stays empty. A. This may be caused by your browser cache. Try a different browser or clear the local cache. Support links for: Chrome FireFox Edge Safari Try the clear only the local cached images and files first. Q. I cannot upload files greater than 50MB in size with the Windows desktop plugin. The plugin returns an error 400. A. This is a limit imposed by the desktop plugin. It can be changed via a registry key entry detailed here: HCL Support page The maximum allowed upload size is 2000MB. Q. What does it mean to make a user inactive? A. When a user's status is set to inactive via the administration tool, they are unable to log in to Connections or any other Collab.Cloud provided services including their web mail and SameTime. Note that if you have an on-premise Domino environment, setting a user to inactive via the administration tool will not prevent them logging into Notes. Q. What does it mean to remove a user's Connections subscription? A. Currently, removing a user's Connections subscription does not prevent a user from logging in to Connections (to do that, you need to make them inactive, but this will also prevent them logging in to their webmail and SameTime). Q. What happens to the files and other shared content of a user after they are set to inactive? A. When a user is made inactive, all content they have posted publicly will remain visible. It is not deleted, and it can still be interacted with. Any private content the user did not share while they were active will be inaccessible. Q. How do I delete Connections users? A. Deleting users is currently not supported. You can prevent a user from logging in to Collab.Cloud services by making them inactive. Q. Are unused accounts ever automatically made inactive? A. No. There is currently no automatic lockout or disabling feature for accounts that are not logged in to for a period of time. Q. Using the HCL Connections Desktop Plugin, can you add desktop shortcuts pointing to files on Connections? A. This is currently not supported by the plugin. Q. What is the Super Admin role that I can see in the administration tool? A. The Super Admin role is for the Three Thirds support team to manage your organisation and fulfil support requests. Q. Why is my Notes plugin for Connections not working? A. Unfortunately the Notes plugin for Connections is not currently supported by HCL Connections Multi-Tenant. Q. When creating new users in the admin app, strange IDs are shown for them. Is this correct? A. Yes, this is correct. As you can see in the above screenshot, SmartCloud IDs weren't consistent regarding length. We decided to use a more technical but consistent pattern. As a side effect, you can easely distinguish between migrated and new users. Q. How do I remove Connections Cloud from my Windows Connector? A. Go to Windows Explorer, find the Connector and connected sites in the left navigation pane (usually towards the bottom), right click on the site you want to remove, and click \"Disconnect from Site\". Q. I have configured my Desktop Connector. Why can't I see my communities? A. Your community information in the desktop plugin is stored client-side. This means we were unable to migrate it and the communities will need to be re-added. Once re-added, you will be able to access your community data. Q. I cannot upload a file ! A.

Please email support@collab.cloud to report any defects that are not listed here. Please also feel welcome to email if you are unsure, or feel that the issue you are experiencing does not quite match up with a known issue documented on this page. Please keep in mind that we have started with a fresh empty environment and have imported thousands of users and a massive amount of data into it in a very short time. During the migration period this temporarily caused slowness and other hiccups on the platform that should now be resolved. Thank you for your continued patience and understanding! Internet Explorer 11 is not Supported \u00b6 Internet Explorer 11 is not supported in our environment. While we realise it is supported in HCL Connections 6.5 on premise, it is not in HCL Connections 6.5 Multi-Tenant. For now, customers have to use a supported browser such as Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. We have filed a request with HCL to support this in future versions of the Connections application. The Survey Functionality is not Available \u00b6 In the previous Connections Cloud platform, there was a survey feature. This is unfortunately not available in the HCL Connections 6.5 Multi-Tenant code. We understand that some customers made significant use of this feature and will want to know whether the functionality will be provided in the future. We have contacted HCL regarding this and will update customers as soon as we receive further information. UPDATE: Statement from HCL: Survey data was excluded from the beginning. I remember that we discussed the feasibility a couple of times but we decided not to pursue survey export with the approaching deadline. This has also been communicated in various calls. Our documentation also lists Surveys as out of scope. Performance Issues when Viewing Documents \u00b6 Our infrastructure has adequate capacity to support the document viewing and editing capabilities of Connections. However there are two issues causing noticable performance issues when working with documents: File thumbnails are constantly being generated for the millions of files we are importing. There may be a bug or configuration issue on one of the servers. We are prioritising this issue as we realise the importance of the document capabilities to our customers. Indefinite Reloads when Starting Sametime in both HCL Notes and the Standalone Client \u00b6 The \"Remember me\" function in login page is not working and will result in a indefinite reload on starting the app on next day. This issue will appear in the embedded Sametime within the Notes client as well as in the Sametime standalone client. Please do not use the \"Remember me\" function until this issue is resolved. The Sametime Connections Plugin is Unavailable \u00b6 The Sametime Connections plugin that provides instant messaging capabilities within your Connections site is currently not working as expected. You will be able to login, however you will not be able to receive messages. Please use Sametime webchat available at webchatna.collab.cloud (for US-based customers) or webchateu.collab.cloud (for EU-based customers) until this issue is resolved. Sametime does not show profile pictures \u00b6 Sametime standalone and Notes Plugin does not show the profile pictures. This is an issue with the HCL Connections for Multi-Tenant code. We currently have an open case with HCL to resolve this issue and will deploy a fix once it is made available to us. Verse integration \u00b6 For customers who have Verse and Connections, the Connections integration in Verse fails if a user starts with Verse. This is an issue with the HCL Connections for Multi-Tenant code. We currently have an open case with HCL to resolve this issue and will deploy a fix once it is made available to us. Wiki \u00b6 Wrong links in Apps menu and API calls to oauth endpoints in wikis return wrong links This is an issue with the HCL Connections for Multi-Tenant code. We currently have an open case with HCL to resolve this issue and will deploy a fix once it is made available to us. External Feeds in ICEC \u00b6 Some external feeds don't show at the moment. This is an issue with the HCL Connections for Multi-Tenant code. We currently have an open case with HCL to resolve this issue and will deploy a fix once it is made available to us. Long Descriptions in Activities Plus are Unavailable \u00b6 The \"long description\" field is not currently available in Activities Plus. Customers may experience either missing data or an error 404 when trying to access the long description field of an Activity. This is due to a problem we are experiencing with the HCL Connections API which is preventing us from importing the long description data into Activities Plus. This is an issue that is occurring with the HCL Connections API. We currently have an open case with HCL to resolve this issue. Activities Plus Community Widget doesn't work in Safari \u00b6 There is a limitation imposed by Apple which stops the Kudos Boards Community Widget from getting users cookies and therefore is stopping Authentication between Kudos Boards Cloud and HCL Connections. The only solution is to disable the \"Prevent cross-site tracking\" option on the user's computer under Safari => Preferences => Privacy. Error 500 in Desktop plugin when trying to connect Delete cache in Internet Options \u00b6 Open \"Internet Options\" either via Internet Explorer - Tools, or via searching for it in Windows Click \"Delete...\" Make sure you select at least \"Temporary Internet files and website files\" and \"Cookies and website data\" Click \"Delete Try again to connect Very Short Timeouts in the Connections Engagement Center \u00b6 There is an issue with very short session timeouts in the Connections Engagement Center which is affecting a number of customers in both the EU and US data centres. This results in a login box appearing which does not accept any credentials. We have taken a number of steps ourselves to resolve this issue and we have now opened a case with HCL. Updates will be provided as soon as the problem is resolved. Activities Plus (Huddo Boards) not shown correctly \u00b6 If you are using Chrome (or Brave) browser you might have faced the following issues with Activities Plus: Doesn't open in the widget Connections header not shown while in the app itself Solution: Go to Settings - Privacy and security - Cookies and other site data Add the following URLs in the section \"Sites that can always use cookies\": Please note: You have to enable \"Including third-party cookies on this site\" Files search results \u00b6 Occasionally when searching for files in Community Files, there will be invalid links in the search results. Clicking the link will lead to an access denied error. This is an issue with the HCL Connections for Multi-Tenant code. We currently have an open case with HCL to resolve this issue and will deploy a fix once it is made available to us. Invalid Links in the Connections Newsletter \u00b6 There is currently an issue with the Connections newsletter sent out by the platform. Some links redirect to the Sorry page, if you are not already logged in. Once you are logged in, the link should work. This is an issue with the HCL Connections for Multi-Tenant code.

A Community Owner/Manager has access rights to do that. To add the Activities Plus widget, go to: Community Actions \u2013 Add Apps in the right hand side of the Community Select Activities Plus in the list Once the widget is added you have the option to show all Community Activities/Boards that belongs to this Community, or a specific Activity/Board. If you want to change these settings after saving, click on the settings wheel inside the widget. The new widget in the Community can be moved by dragging and dropping, or by clicking on the three dots in the upper right corner. A great tip is to move the Activities Plus widget so it covers the whole page, by dragging and dropping. When the widget is larger you get a better overview of your work. If the Community already is a member of an Activity you will directly see that Activity in the widget. Start working immediately! If you do not see any Activities you can add Activities now. Add an existing Activity into the widget \u00b6 Go to the Activities Plus page by clicking Apps \u2013 Activities Plus in the Menu Bar Open the Activity of your choice by clicking on it. Open the Members section of the Activity by clicking on Members in the right hand side In the field Add individuals or groups type the first letters of the Community name you want to add the Activity to, and select it. All members of this Community will now be added as members into the Activity. The Activity will also be added into the Community, and be visible in the widget. Before you click Add Members and close the dialogue box you have the option to set access rights for the members who will be added to the Activity.
